# Analyzing Credit Risk

A machine learning credit risk analysis using resampling models and classifiers.

## Overview
This project will use several methods of machine learning to assess credit risk. The following models will be used:
- RandomOverSampler
- SMOTE
- ClusterCentroids
- SMOTEENN
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier
- EasyEnsembleClassifier

For each model, we'll look at the Balanced Accuracy Score, as well as the precision and recall for risk performance (high and low)


## Results
#### RandomOverSampler
